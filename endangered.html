	      <h1>Deminishing Endanngered Species of the Wild</h1>
        <p>
            According to scientists, around 150-200 species of plant and animal go extinct every 24 hours. This statistic doesn’t seem so shocking until the realization comes that this is almost 1,000 times the natural rate for extinction. Humans contribute a great amount to this pandemic. A prime example is that of the dodo bird, which was famously hunted into extinction. Around 20,000 species are currently listed as threatened by extinction by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).When assessing the status of a species, one of the factors for the IUCN is that the species must be declining at a certain rate over the course of a certain number of years. People need to work to protect endangered species.<p>While some laws, such as the 1973 Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 have worked on animal conservation, humans as a whole need to feel more inclined to help the animals in need in any way they could. There are laws and rules all over the world for the protection of species, but some people, such as poachers, simply ignore these laws and continue to pursue the endangered creatures. People should want to help protect these endangered species, more than the people who want to harm them. The protection of endangered species is supported by different ethical theories. One of the ethical theories that supports protecting endangered species is consequentialism. Consequentialism is the ethical theory that makes the moral decision of whether something is good or not based on the consequences that come from said action.... Wikipedia

        <h2>Southern Cassowary </h2>
        <p>The southern cassowary, also known as double-wattled cassowary, Australian cassowary or two-wattled cassowary, is a large flightless black bird. It is one of the three living species of cassowary, alongside the dwarf cassowary and the northern cassowary.The southern cassowary is one of Australia's most imposing birds – large, colourful, and flightless is found only in the dense tropical rainforests of north-east Queensland. Continuing clearing and fragmentation of rainforest, and increased mortality from cars and dogs have reduced cassowary numbers to perhaps as few as around 2000, threatening the species with extinction.</p> 

            <p>The southern cassowary Casuarius casuarius belongs to an ancient group of flightless birds that includes Australia's emu, Africa's ostrich and New Zealand's kiwi and now-extinct moa. As tall as an adult human (up to 170 centimetres), the female southern cassowary is Australia's heaviest bird. The cassowary has draping, shiny black plumage and a colourful naked neck and head – brilliant blue and purple with long, drooping red wattles and an amber eye – topped with a helmet-like structure known as a casque. The colour of the skin changes with mood, brightening when the bird is aroused.</p>
            
            The cassowary has no tail, and its wing stubs carry a small number of long, modified quills, like rounded fingernails, which curve around the body. Each heavy, well-muscled leg has three toes, with the inside toe bearing a large dagger-shaped claw that can be used in defence. When the bird is cornered or protecting chicks, it kicks out with both feet at once, and can injure, or even kill, dogs or humans. More usually, it dashes off when alarmed, head lowered, casque first, through the heavy undergrowth. It reaches 40 kilometres per hour in short sprints and can even swim...Wikipedia</p>

        <h2>Redpanda</h2>
        <p>The red panda is slightly larger than a domestic cat with a bear-like body and thick russet fur. The belly and limbs are black, and there are white markings on the side of the head and above its small eyes. Red pandas are very skillful and acrobatic animals that predominantly stay in trees. Almost 50% of the red panda’s habitat is in the Eastern Himalayas. They use their long, bushy tails for balance and to cover themselves in winter, presumably for warmth. Primarily an herbivore, the name panda is said to come from the Nepali word ‘ponya,’ which means bamboo or plant eating animal.<p>The red panda is dwarfed by the black-and-white giant that shares its name. These pandas typically grow to the size of a house cat, though their big, bushy tails add an additional 18 inches. The pandas use their ringed tails as wraparound blankets in the chilly mountain heights.

            Habitat and Behavior
            
            The red panda shares the giant panda's rainy, high-altitude forest habitat, but has a wider range. Red pandas live in the mountains of Nepal and northern Myanmar (Burma), as well as in central China.
            
            These animals spend most of their lives in trees and even sleep aloft. When foraging, they are most active at night as well as in the gloaming hours of dusk and dawn.
            
            Red pandas have a taste for bamboo but, unlike their larger relatives, they eat many other foods as well—fruit, acorns, roots, and eggs. Like giant pandas, they have an extended wrist bone that functions almost like a thumb and greatly aids their grip.

        <h2>Prothonotary Warbler</h2>
        <p>
            A typical resident of southwestern Ontario, this warbler is threatened both here in Ontario and abroad in its winter home. Habitat destruction and the draining of swamps here in Ontario lead the way in hindering the survival of this bird, while the loss of mangrove swamps in Central and South America are negatively affecting them during the winter months.<p>These medium-sized shorebirds are threatened mainly by a loss of food at their key migration sites. Pollution, recreation, and urban development at these migration sites is having a negative effect on these birds while they are away during the winter months, while climate change is having a serious impact on their nesting habitat in the Arctic tundra.

                Yellow-Breasted Chat
                
                Found in most parts of the United States, this bird is only present in western Canada and in southwestern Ontario. It is not believed to ever have been a common presence in the province, but it is believed that the over-management of farmland is of the leading causes in the decline of the population of this species in the province.</p>

        <h2>Siberian Tiger</h2>
        <p>Siberian (or Amur) tigers are the world's largest cats.</p>
        <p>The Siberian tiger, a subspecies of tiger, is the largest cat in the world. It averages about 3.3 m (11 ft.) in length, with a tail measuring 1 m (3 ft.). Adult male Siberian tigers can weigh up to 320 kg (700 lb.), while females are significantly smaller, weighing up to 180 kg (400 lb.).

            Siberian tigers are distinguishable by their striped fur. Similar to people’s unique fingerprints, no two tigers have the same striped pattern. Siberian tigers differ from other tigers because they have fewer, paler stripes, and they also have manes. The mane, in addition to their thick fur, helps keep them warm.
            
            Also known as the Amur tiger, the Siberian tiger resides in a small region in the southeast region Russia. <p>They are also located in small numbers in China and North Korea.
            
            Siberian tigers are solitary animals, marking their scent on trees to keep other tigers away. They roam many miles and hunt often. They stalk their prey, which include elk, boar, bears, and deer, until they are close enough to pounce. When successful, they drag their kill to a secluded area before devouring the meat.Tigers also hunt smaller animals like rabbits, pikas, and fish.
            
            Because tigers are not always successful on their hunts, they need to hunt often. They can eat up to 27 kg (60 lb.) if they are very hungry, but generally they eat about 9 kg (20 lb.) of meat in one.</p>

        <h2>Orange Frog</h2>
        <p>The orange-thighed frog is a species of tree frog native to a small area of tropical northern Queensland, Australia. It is a green frog with distinctly orange eyes, and is very similar in appearance to the red-eyed tree frog. .</p>
        <p>Discovered in 1973 and first scientifically described in 1978, the Golden Poison Frog is one of the largest of the poison dart frogs and it can grow to 5 centimetres. Its bright colour can vary, especially geographically, but is either golden-orange, golden-yellow or pale green.

        <h2>Gray Crown Crane</h2>
        <p>The grey crowned crane is about 1 m (3.3 ft) tall, weighs 3.5 kg (7.7 lbs), and has a wingspan of 2 m (6.5 ft). Its body plumage is mainly grey. The wings are predominantly white, but contain feathers with a range of colours, with a distinctive black patch at the very top. The head has a crown of stiff golden feathers. The sides of the face are white, and there is a bright red inflatable throat pouch. The bill is relatively short and grey, and the legs are black. They have long legs for wading through the grasses. The feet are large, yet slender, adapted for balance rather than defence or grasping. The sexes are similar, although males tend to be slightly larger. Young birds are greyer than adults, with a feathered buff face.

          This species and the black-crowned crane are the only cranes that can roost in trees, because of a long hind toe that can grasp branches. This trait is assumed to be an ancestral trait among the cranes, which has been lost in the other subfamily. Crowned cranes also lack a coiled trachea and have loose plumage compared to the other cranes.[3]
          
          .</p>
        <p>The grey crowned crane has a breeding display involving dancing, bowing, and jumping. It has a booming call which involves inflation of the red gular sac. It also makes a honking sound quite different from the trumpeting of other crane species. Both sexes dance, and immature birds join the adults. Dancing is an integral part of courtship, but also may be done at any time of the year.

          Flocks of 30–150 birds are not uncommon Grey crowned cranes time their breeding season around the rains, although the effect varies geographically. In East Africa the species breeds year-round, but most frequently during the drier periods, whereas in Southern Africa the breeding season is timed to coincide with the rains.[2] During the breeding season, pairs of cranes construct a large nest; a platform of grass and other plants in tall wetland vegetation. The grey crowned crane lays a clutch of 2-5 glossy, dirty-white eggs, which are incubated by both sexes for 28–31 days. Chicks are precocial, can run as soon as they hatch, and fledge in 56–100 days. Once they are fully grown and independent, chicks of different sexes will separate from their parents to start their own family. Grey crowned cranes have been seen to congregate in large numbers in a ceremony akin to a wedding when two chicks are being married off. The new couple dance for a while before flying off together to start a new family...Wikipedia</p>
